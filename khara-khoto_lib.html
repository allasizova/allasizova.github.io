The Tibetan edition is of particular importance, because until recently specimens of printing in Tibetan, that could belong to an earlier date, have not been found anywhere. All the editions are equal in terms of their contents and contain the postscript written by the Emperor Renzong. The main goal of the article is to introduce the previously unpublished Tibetan text of the postscript in correspondence with the Tangut and Chinese versions. Besides, the article provides information about the study, preservation state, and codicology of all the three editions.",

The preserved fragment includes two texts dedicated to the Buddhist deity Mañjuśrī. This paper presents a brief archaeographic description of the block print, a transliteration and translation of the surviving parts of the texts.",

(p. 94)<br>The objects inside the Baisigou Square Stupa were probably placed there soon after 1180. One other object found in the rubble may perhaps be connected to the sixtieth birthday celebrations of 1184: it is another printed dharani (prayer) text, the Ushnishavijaya dharani with an image of Ushnishavijaya surrounded by the Sanskrit text (Fig. 3). (p. 96–97).<br>The Ushnishavijaya dharani was well-known in Japan and China, but in East Asia the personified image is extremely rare. Instead, the dharani alone served as the ritual focus. Both Chinese and Sanskrit versions were engraved onto dharani pillars in China.[22] The dharani, if not the personification, is well attested in north-central China in general, in Dali (Yunnan), Liao and Jin contexts in particular, and even Yuan.[23] The original religious context of Ushnishavijaya was certainly cult Mahayana, but it proved to be of interest to those practicing Esoteric Buddhism in China as well. This is demonstrated by both textual and visual evidence. First, there are retranslations of the sutra after Buddhapali’s version of 683 by the eighth century Esoteric masters Subhakarasimha (d. 735, T. 973) and Amoghavajra (705-774, T. 972). Then there are the finds of (non-personified) Ushnlshavijaya mandala at Dunhuang,[24] and finally, the mandala-like contexts surrounding the dharani inscribed in both Sanskrit and Chinese the Dali kingdom of Yunnan.[25](p. 98–99)<br>For reasons which are still not clear to me, the personified form is virtually unknown in East Asia apart from later Tibetan-inspired examples. This is true despite the fact that her description is given in great detail by the versions of the which continued to be translated into Chinese. These descriptions correspond loosely to the few images which are attested in India, but much more closely to the plentiful images in Nepalese, Tibetan and Tangut Xia contexts.[26] In the textual descriptions she is associated with stupa building; indeed, she is described as residing within the womb of the stupa. One of the Chinese translations of her sadhana ritual texts, made in 994 and probably available to the Tanguts, repeatedly instructs the practitioner to make a stupa, paint her image within the dharanl, and place this inside the stupa.[27] Three-faced and eight-armed, she carries a bow and an arrow, a noose, a crossed- or vishva-vajra in front of her chest, a vase full of amrit in her lap, and she makes the abhaya and varada mudras. Perhaps her most distinctive attribute is that she carries a small image of Amitabha Buddha in her upper right hand. In a few examples, instead of carrying it at her shoulder, she is shown placing the Buddha image on her head. Her body and main head is white, while the other heads are yellow and dark blue. [28] (p. 99–100)<br>Considering Ushnlshavijaya’s rather specialized iconography, a surprisingly generous number of Ushnishavijaya texts and images were recovered from Khara Khoto by Kozlov and then by Aurel Stein. These include two mandalas painted on wood panels in the Himalayan style, dated to the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, in which she is clearly seated within a stupa; a similarly dated painting on wood that was meant to be inserted into a seating of some sort (it has been suggested that it was structurally connected to a stupa); and the upper portion of a Himalayan-style printed image now in New Delhi[29] (Fig. 4). Here again she is clearly seated inside the stupa.(p. 100)<br>",

In previous studies, I focused on the five manuscripts related to Bka' gdams pa school, which were discovered at the fortress of Xixia kingdom, Khara-khoto. The description of <i>Rgyal ba'i dben gnas rwa sgreng gi bshad pa nyi ma'i 'od</i> may explain why manuscripts of texts belonging to the Bka' gdams pa school's literary legacy were discovered at Khara-khoto.

				publicationNotes: "Documents both in Tibetan and Xi Xia characters show that Tibetan Buddhism once prevailed in Xi Xia Kingdom and many Buddhism masters from Tibet were employed as imperial masters during the late period of the 12th century. Influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, a great number of Tibetan Buddhism documents were translated in Xi Xia Kingdom. A large scale of activities of correcting and translating Buddhism scriptures were promoted during the reign of King Ren Zong (1139-1193 A. D.), many Tibetan Buddhism monks also participated in collation work and there were signs left in the documents. This paper is based on summarizing the documents of Xi Xia Kingdom's Buddhism scriptures, the writer surveys the Tibetan translating principles from the documental stylistic rules, Buddhism terms, Dharani words and grammatical rules. All of these show that the features are different from the translating principles in Central Plain. With the impact of Tibetan Buddhism, the Tibetan features are also obvious in Dun Huang manuscripts and the Buddhism scriptures translated and edited during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. Such features are universal significant in identifying and studying on the Buddhism translated texts influenced by Tibetan Buddhism.",

				publicationNotes: "A vision of Acala, the Unwavering, emanating ten furious figures and trampling the elephant-headed Gaṇapati, is a common sight in the art of Tibet and the Tangut Empire (ca. 1038-1227, in Chinese sources known as Xixia 西夏) up to the end of the 13th century. This form of Acala is said to have been taught by the Serlingpa guru (Tib. Bla ma gSer gling pa) of the eponymous ‘Golden Isles’ of Southeast Asia. Its praxis was transmitted to Tibet by his famous Bengali student, Jowojé (Tib. jo bo rje) Atiśa Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna (982-1054), who was simply called Dīpaṃkara in the Tangut Empire. As so few traces of these individuals and their praxis traditions were preserved outside the Tibetosphere, it can be asked whether this distinctive vision of Acala was ever taught by a Southeast Asian teacher. The study of this figure allows light to be shed on a rare convergence between the northern and maritime routes of the Silk Road. This chapter examines the writings on Acala attributed to the Serlingpa guru and Dīpaṃkara in conjunction with numerous related works of art, some of which have not previously been associated with the tradition of the Golden Isles.",

Moreover it also indicates that those copies in Yuan cuts are arranged according to the numbers based on the phonetic transcription of the called Chian-Zyh-Wen (千字文). The chief editor of the edition is a Budhist Guaan-Juu-Ba 管主八(廣福大師) and it was edited at Harng-Jou (杭州).<br>At the end of this chapter I try to explain the meaning of the characters ？ and 𘟩. But there may be errors. I have to ask my readers to refer to the last chapter of this essay. I attach two tables at the end: one to illustrate the importation of the tripiṭaka to Shishiah and the edition of the Shishiah tripiṭaka and the other to illustrate the various editions of tripiṭaka.",

Lastly there is really less difference between the various “咒 dhāraṇī” in both of them than in others. But it is quite different from the Chinese version.

He mentioned that three pages of them belong to the 大般若經. He also indicated where they had been selected from.<br>At the end of this paper, there is a discussion about the Shishiah words “𘋢𗋐”, “𗫔𘎳” and “𗩾𗨁”. In 金光明經, “𘋢𗋐” was used to translate “有情” and “𗫔𘎳” to translate “衆生”. These two Chinese terms 有情 and 衆生 really mean the same thing. This Shishiah translation therefore points to a very close word-for-word translation of the Chinese text. In the second case, “𗩾𗨁” means “最上”. But the original Sanskrit word is “anuttara”, meaning “無更上”, and the Chinese translation is “無上”. That the Shishiah translator here did not follow closely the Chinese words may be due to certain usage of that language which forbids a direct translation.",

The extant versions of the “Sutra on the Merit of the Former Vows of the Beryl Illumination of Master of Medicine Buddha of the Seven Buddhas” in Russian, British, and French collections also indicate that the belief in the Medicine Buddha was widespread in the Hexi Corridor region.",

				publicationNotes: "This paper compares the initial translation of the Tangut version of the “Assembly of Limitless Adornments, Pure Dhāraṇī Chapter” from the Huizong period (Инв.№7377) and the revised translation from the Renzong period (Инв.№373), both unearthed from Khara-Khoto and housed in Russian collections. The study examines the correspondences between the two versions, focusing on differences in the use of characters for transcribing mantras, grammatical characters, and erroneous characters. It can be seen that although №373 reflects the translation standards of the Renzong period in terms of the use of characters for transcribing sounds, the errors and interchangeable characters in the text also indicate that this revised translation is not without its inaccuracies.",

				publicationNotes: "The Tangut Buddhist canon boasts a rich collection, often containing multiple versions of the same sutra. Through comparative studies of these different versions, we can gain insights into the evolution of language and script usage throughout the entire process—from initial translation, copying, and carving to later proofreading and editing. This paper systematically analyzes the main types of textual revisions found in Tangut Buddhist scriptures, examining them from both the perspectives of script and language. On the script level, revisions include variations like phonetic loans, variant characters, and taboo characters. On the language level, differences primarily lie in word choice and sentence structure. The linguistic materials gathered from these textual revisions hold significant value for various fields such as philology, phonology, and lexicography. Not only can they help determine the translation dates of different sutra versions, but they also contribute to our understanding of Tangut phonology, correct character identification, confirm character interchangeability, determine word meanings, and explore grammatical structures.",

				publicationNotes: "The Tangut translation of the “Dhāraṇī Sutra of the Lamp of Knowledge” [Jñānolka] was based on the Chinese Buddhist text of the same name translated by Devêndraprajña (提雲般若). However, the transliteration of the dhāraṇī in the Tangut text exhibits different phonetic patterns compared to the Chinese version. By comparing the Tangut text with its Chinese and Tibetan counterparts, we find that the transliteration of the mantra in the Tangut version aligns with the phonetic features of Sanskrit-Tibetan transliteration. This suggests that the mantra was likely revised by monks familiar with Sanskrit and Tibetan. The transliteration patterns in Tangut Buddhist sutras reflect two distinct translation sources: those translated from Chinese Buddhist texts adhere to the phonetic rules of Chinese transliteration, while those translated from Tibetan Buddhist texts follow Sanskrit-Tibetan transliteration conventions. Therefore, the alignment of Tangut transliteration with Sanskrit, Tibetan, or Chinese transliteration patterns can serve as an indicator of whether a Tangut translation has a Tibetan Buddhist background. Furthermore, historical records indicate that Emperor Renzong of the Western Xia dynasty initiated a large-scale sutra collation project, with a particular focus on correcting the transliteration of mantras. The transliteration patterns in the Tangut translation of the “Dhāraṇī Sutra of the Lamp of Knowledge” provide additional evidence beyond colophons to support the existence of this significant sutra collation endeavor during Emperor Renzong's reign.",

				publicationNotes: "“Caca” are small, mold-made clay sculptures used for Buddhist offerings. The Tibetan term “tsha-tsha” is generally believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word “satchaya”, meaning “perfect image” or “replica”. The earliest recorded use of “tsha-tsha” in Chinese historical texts dates back to the Yuan dynasty, corresponding to the Tibetan term. During the Western Xia period, the Chinese characters “截截 jiéjié” were used as a translation, written as “𗈿𗈿 tshja¹tshja¹” in Tangut script. The fact that the Chinese character “截 jié”, a fourth division entering tone character with the 屑 (xiè) rhyme and 從 (cóng) initial, corresponds to the Tibetan “tsha” supports the phonological rules of 12th-century Hexi Chinese. These rules include the shift of voiced 從 (cóng) initials to aspirated voiceless consonants and the loss of entering tone finals.",

Through a comparative study with the Tibetan text and the Chinese translations by Amoghavajra (不空) of Tang and Bodhiruci (菩提流志) of Tang, it is believed that this sutra was translated with reference to both the Tibetan and Chinese texts. Compared to the Tibetan text, the Tangut version is closer to the Chinese translations by Amoghavajra and Bodhiruci in terms of style, and its writing style is most similar to Amoghavajra's translation of the “Most Secret Well-Established Dhāraṇī of the Vast Gem-Encrusted Pavilion”.",

The appended colophon mentions that this Tangut Buddhist scripture is based on the “Prajñāpāramitā Upadeśa Dignified Commentary on Realizations” by Haribhadra, intended as a commentary on the “Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra”. Through reassembling and detailed examination of the surviving fragments of this manuscript, it is found that although the manuscript is titled “Explanation”, it does not actually contain any commentary-related content. Instead, it is the main verse from the famous “Five Treatises of Maitreyanātha”, specifically the “Prajñāpāramitā Upadeśa Dignified Verses on Realizations”. The №5130 manuscript includes parts of the first chapter (the Introduction) and the eighth chapter (the Dharma Body). The colophon at the end of the Tangut translation of the “Verses on Realizations” notes that it is the most detailed colophon among the published Tangut manuscripts to date, recording the entire process of translating the Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit and Tibetan into Tangut, including collation, proofreading, and printing. The article also provides a detailed examination of the dissemination of this text in Tibetan and Tangut literature.",

The interpretation is conducted with reference to the Chinese translation of the sutra by Guṇabhadra during the Liu Song Dynasty. Semi-cursive script occupies a stylistic space between cursive and regular script, and Tangut manuscripts written in this style are relatively rare in existing scholarship. As an independent text within the tradition of the Kṣudraka Āgama, the interpretation of this semi-cursive manuscript of the “Sūtra of the Four Types of People Appearing in the World” not only provides foundational linguistic data for the study of Tangut Buddhism and the Tangut language, but also holds significant value for further understanding Tangut cursive script and, by extension, the interpretation of cursive Tangut documents.",

They also speculated that many of the Chinese texts included in the “Daocheng Yaodao Miji” might have been first translated by Tanguts. Through comparison, we found that some Tangut texts match both in title and content, while others, although sharing the same title, have significantly different content. This fact reminds us to be cautious: while there are undeniable connections between Tangut and Chinese texts, reflecting the deep connection between the Tangut and Tibetan esoteric Buddhism in the Yuan dynasty, we cannot simply rely on the titles of Tangut texts to determine whether the Chinese texts might have been translated first by Tanguts. Tangut texts and Chinese texts with the same title might not originate from the same lineage, meaning that the Sakya and Kagyu sub-schools practiced in Tangut might have been quite different from the schools prevalent in the Yuan dynasty.",

The Tangut translators integrated their own understanding of the scriptures into the translation and corrected some omissions in the Chinese text. Furthermore, through several collations, the paper discovers differences in language and expression between the earlier and later volumes of the Tangut version.

From the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, to the Sui and Tang dynasties, various translators compiled and translated more than 60 volumes in 23 sections, known as the “Old Translations”. Bodhiruci later translated 39.5 volumes in 26 sections, known as the “New Translations”. The existing “Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra” is a combination of the New and Old Translations, containing 49 sections in total. According to the system of the “Kaiyuan Record”, the “Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra”, “Avataṃsaka Sūtra”, “Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra”, “Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra”, and “Nirvana Sutra” are considered the five major sutras in Chinese Buddhism. Bodhiruci's compiled version of the “Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra” spread to the Tangut kingdom and was translated into Tangut, with various versions circulating. From the British collection of Tangut Buddhist texts from the Khara-Khoto, nine fragments of the Tangut “Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra” have been discovered. These fragments, completed during the Song-Chang period, contain individual sutra texts translated by people like Jielaohu, Mandaraksena, Bodhiruci, and Sivananda.",

				publicationNotes: "The Chinese version of the Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra comprises 600 scrolls. The Tanguts translated the first 450 scrolls, using 45 Tangut characters as translation marks. Kychanov’s “Catalogue of Tangut Buddhist Texts” only compiled the first 40 marks. Due to the limitations of Tangut character recording at the time, some of the characters are incorrect. This article corrects the omitted or incorrect Tangut characters, and newly supplements five marks from scrolls 401-450, providing the academic community with a more accurate Tangut original work, “The Ten Characters”. Finally, the article re-translates this short text of only 45 characters and argues that it is a Tangut divination prayer story, reflecting the cosmology of the Tangut people. It bears a close relationship to Tibetan divination prayer stories.",

Furthermore, the joined document reveals that the belief in Duowen Tianwang in the Xixia period differed significantly from that of the Tang and Song dynasties, which likely relates to the fact that the Buddhism practiced in Xixia was primarily esoteric in nature.",

				publicationNotes: "Existing Tangut texts related to the “Śūraṃngama Sūtra” have been unearthed from the Baisigou Pagoda, the Shanzuigou Caves, and Khara-Khoto. The Han text from the Baisigou Pagoda originates from the 5th juan of the “Śūraṃngama Sūtra”, specifically the content of the “Great Strength Bodhisattva’s Chapter on Mind-Clearness Through Reciting Buddha”, which was considered one of the “Five Sūtras and One Treatise” by Li Shizong. It shares a common Pure Land theme with other scriptures, and was titled “Collection of Essentials from Various Sutras”. The Tangut inscription fragment from the Shanzuigou Caves is a commentary on the “Śūraṃngama Sutra” by Zixuan, the sixth ancestor of the Huayan School during the early Song dynasty, who was known as the “Śūraṃngama Master”. The deciphered fragments correspond to the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th juan of the “Śūraṃngama Sutra”. The “Collection of Secret Mantras and Round Causes for Rebirth” and the “Collection of All Precepts and Explanations of Zen Origins” from Khara-Khoto also contain content related to the “Śūraṃngama Sutra”. These texts not only reflect the spread of Pure Land, Huayan, Esoteric and Zen Buddhism in Xixia, but also demonstrate the widespread influence of the “Śūraṃngama Sutra” in Xixia, being selectively adopted by various schools of thought. Notably, the existence of a commentary on the “Śūraṃngama Sutra” in Tangut suggests that the scripture itself was quite popular in Xixia.",

				publicationNotes: "Roof decoration is a crucial aspect of traditional Chinese wooden architecture. The roofs of important buildings often consist of roof surfaces, ridges, slopes, and gables. Decorative elements, apart from roof ends and drip-eaves, primarily include various animal figures. In extant Tang and Song Dynasty buildings, these animal figures are often replaced by later generations, losing their original form. However, in the Tangut Mausoleums, perfectly preserved ridge beasts, crouching beasts, hanging beasts, and squatting beasts dating back to the Tangut period have been unearthed. These complete sets of animal figures, including dragons, are all present, without any missing pieces. The unearthed roof decorations from the Tangut Mausoleums, especially the crouching beasts, hanging beasts, and squatting beasts, have never been seen elsewhere and are completely different from traditional roof components in the Central Plains. This makes it difficult to name them. This article explores the names of these components based on their actual shape, their connection to Buddhism, and the rich Tangut cultural connotations they embody, thereby proving that they constitute a unique and distinct roof decoration system, separate from the Central Plains.",

It mixes elements of Buddhism, Daoism, and folk beliefs, reflecting the characteristics of religious syncretism in folk religious practice. Several parts of A-32, including “Yanfuli,” “Liang Wu Jiangli,” “Yinsi Mingdian,” “Tuiding Ernü Fa,” “Foshuo Shousheng Jing (Yanshou Zhenyan),” and “Dajin Guo Lu Xi Yao Mou Gao Ww Sīma Chuan Wen Wangsheng Zhuanlun Jing Zhi Jian La,” form a whole as the ritual of “Shousheng Jing.” This ritual consists of ceremonies such as liturgical chanting, confession, and offering incense, which are combined with sutra chanting in the belief of Shousheng. By referencing the newly discovered folk Buddhist document of the Northern Song Dynasty, “Mingdao San Nian (1033) Fu Jianzhu Jian Yang Xian Pu'en Shi Si Jieji Zai Di San Hui Gong Shou Dizi Shi Qi Yongzhai Xun,” this article explores the differences between folk Buddhist beliefs, represented by Shousheng Jiku, and elite Buddhism since the Song dynasty.

				publicationNotes: "The study of Xixia Buddhism has made significant strides in the early 21st century, largely due to the successive publication of Xixia Buddhist texts held in China, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. This progress is further fueled by the excavation and publication of new Xixia documents and archaeological materials from sites like the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, as well as the widespread availability of electronic versions of the “Buddhist Canon” and advancements in computer technology. These factors have created unprecedented opportunities for collating and identifying fragmented Xixia Buddhist scriptures. Such a confluence of favorable conditions has fostered remarkable dynamism in Xixia Buddhist studies in recent years within China, laying a solid foundation for more systematic and in-depth research in the future. This paper reviews the current state of Xixia Buddhist studies in China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) from five perspectives: Xixia Buddhist literature, Xixia printing and editions, Xixia Buddhist history, the relationship between Xixia and neighboring Buddhist traditions, and Xixia grotto art and archaeology. Additionally, the paper explores future prospects for Xixia studies while addressing areas requiring further improvement and refinement.",

				publicationNotes: "Originally built during the Xixia Dynasty, the Longwang Temple on the Heihe River in Zhangye has, over a long history, become closely intertwined with the lives and production of the people in the Heihe River Basin. It carries a wealth of historical information, including details about local ethnicities, religious beliefs, administrative institutions, and agricultural practices. For instance, the stele inscribed with Emperor Li Renxiao's edict to the gods of the Heihe River, erected at the Lower Longwang Temple, records that Emperor Li Renxiao personally visited the Heihe Bridge and offered sacrifices to the Dragon God and other deities, praying for the “permanent cessation of floods and the enduring stability of the bridge”. This demonstrates the great importance the Xixia rulers placed on agricultural production; it also reflects that the region frequently experienced floods rather than droughts. This contrasts sharply with the water scarcity and frequent droughts that plagued the region in the later Ming and Qing dynasties.",

Second, the structure is always the Tanguts surrendering their cities, then breaking the agreement, and finally perishing (three stages). This mode of compilation, or rather tradition, originated in “The Secret History of the Mongols”, the first historical book of the Mongol people. The annalistic structure centered on the “history of the Khan's reign” and the selection of historical materials aimed at enhancing “legitimacy” are the fundamental reasons for this phenomenon. Regarding the narrative of the Tangut part, “Altan Tobchi” written in 1677 basically retains the original appearance of “The Secret History of the Mongols”.",

A comparison with the Dunhuang manuscript “Seven Stages Buddha Name Sutra, vol. 1” reveals that the two “Yin Chao Li” texts from Khara-Khoto are independent and complete liturgical repentance texts, and they preserve the rituals of Buddhist chanting and preaching. The religious practice of repentance followed by chanting and preaching, as reflected in the “Yin Chao Li”, was a widespread Buddhist practice from the Wei, Jin, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Although the Three Stages Sect had perished by the Xia and Yuan periods, as a popular form of liturgical repentance literature and ritual within both Buddhist circles and secular society, “Yin Chao Li,” along with the Six-Time Repentance, continued to be widely practiced in ancient Chinese society.",

				publicationNotes: "The Tangut language boasts a rich collection of Buddhist scriptures, with multiple versions of the same sutra often existing. Through the comparative study and collation of these different versions, we can gain insights into the evolution of language and script usage throughout the entire process of Buddhist scripture transmission, from initial translation, copying, and printing to later collation. This article analyzes the main types of Tangut Buddhist scripture collation from both the textual and linguistic perspectives. Textual aspects include the use of loan characters, variant characters, and taboo characters. Linguistic aspects primarily involve differences in wording and phrasing. The linguistic materials obtained through collation hold significant value in fields such as philology, phonology, and exegesis. Not only can they be used to determine the translation dates of different versions of Buddhist scriptures, but they also play a role in understanding the phonetic features of the Tangut language, correcting characters, verifying loan character usage, ascertaining word meanings, and exploring grammatical rules.",

				publicationNotes: "The dating and identification of the redrawn murals of Pure Land Bodhisattvas in the passageway and main chamber of Cave No. 55 at Mogao Grottoes have not previously attracted scholarly attention. However, similar Bodhisattva images were widely painted in a group of renovated and repainted caves during the late Cao regime and the Xixia period. Based on the clear construction history of Cave No. 55, this paper proposes that the repainting of the murals took place during the Xixia period. Furthermore, the strong Pure Land iconographic elements and colors present in the repainted Bodhisattva images represent the culmination of the simplified Pure Land style popular in Dunhuang grottoes during the Song and Xixia periods. The significant difference in the thematic pairing of these Bodhisattva rows in Caves No. 55 and 146 compared to similar images from the Cao regime provides crucial evidence for dating a group of caves at Mogao Grottoes that feature similar Bodhisattvas but were repainted in other styles. This finding suggests a Xixia-era repainting for Mogao Caves No. 366, 281, 328, 151, 263, 224, 326, 351, 353, 354, and Yulin Caves No. 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 26. Consequently, this study offers new possibilities for the chronological reassessment of a group of caves previously broadly categorized within the Song-Xixia period but lacking precise dating. The scale of renovation and repainting projects undertaken during the Xixia period needs to be reevaluated.",

This study examines the images and Sanskrit Dharani inscriptions on this “Sha Fu”, analyzing its stylistic features, Dharani script characteristics, and the composition of the Sanskrit text. By comparing these elements with the dating of Dunhuang Buddhist sand mandala documents, along with evidence from Xixia-era stamped Buddhist images and Dharani inscriptions, this paper proposes that the “Sha Fu” is likely a printing plate used for creating stamped Buddhist images and Dharani texts in the Dunhuang region from the mid-to-late Xixia period to the early Yuan Dynasty. This finding reveals the unique adaptations made in the Hexi region during the Xixia and Yuan Dynasties regarding the combination of Tibetan Buddhist deities, modifications to iconographic rituals, and the distinctive characteristics of Sanskrit Dharani usage.",
